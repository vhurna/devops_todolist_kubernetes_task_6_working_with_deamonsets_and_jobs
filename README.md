# Django ToDo list

This is a todo list web application with basic features of most web apps, i.e., accounts/login, API, and interactive UI. To do this task, you will need:

- CSS | [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
- JS  | [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Explore

Try it out by installing the requirements (the following commands work only with Python 3.8 and higher, due to Django 4):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a database schema:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

And then start the server (default is http://localhost:8000):

```
python manage.py runserver
```

Now you can browse the [API](http://localhost:8000/api/) or start on the [landing page](http://localhost:8000/).
